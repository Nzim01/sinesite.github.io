# Getting Ready with Rea

It's true for most students that finding something to wear every day can be a taxing task. Campus looks can be difficult to find for multiple reasons. Furthermore, my many years of wearing a school uniform at boarding school did not leave me adequately prepared. UCT students have the additional challenge of finding an outfit suitable for all four seasons in one day. Something warm for the morning, waterproof for a bit later, something light and breezy for the afternoon and maybe a scarf and a windbreaker for the walk home.

However, for some these issues seem trivial as there are students who kill their campus looks every single day. One of these students is none other than the unofficial campus celebrity, [Rea Botlholo](https://www.instagram.com/skinnylegwinya/). For the inside scoop on how to overcome all these challenges I not only got the chance to ask Rea for some guidance but also an exclusive campus photo shoot.

Rea never fails to pull out runway-worthy outfits every day. And if you’ve ever had the privilege of seeing these meticulously well put together outfits you’re left asking yourself: HOW?

***“I usually start with a scathing hot shower, then brush my teeth and wash my face and then lotion my skin and then choose what I’m wearing for the day.”***

However, I’m sure most of us know that choosing an outfit is never as easy as it seems. Personally, if I don’t know what I’m wearing the night before, it could take me between ten minutes and three and a half hours to decide what to wear. If you’re ever stuck ask yourself: What would Rea do?

***“If this ever happens. The first thing I’d do is find a garment or item that I haven’t worn yet or worn in a long time and work from there. Or if I’m in a rush for something I throw on a pair of jeans or a tracksuit and keep it moving!!”***

Who would you say is your ultimate fashion icon?

***“UGGGHH, I honestly can’t pick one. But if I had to choose only one, it’d be Rihanna. I just think everything she does is with this cool, meticulous nonchalance as if she didn’t even try to look amazing. I love how daring she is when choosing looks. In my opinion, Rihanna can literally make ANYTHING look amazing. “***

Rihanna not only has an incredible fashion sense but she also teaches us an invaluable lesson about individuality through her line [SAVAGE X FENTY](https://www.savagex.com/). Rihanna describes her lingerie line as being about respect, being unapologetically yourself and embracing individuality. As one of my personal icons, I look up to Rea for this exact reason. Rea is always brave, expressive and most importantly completely unapologetic when it comes to choosing outfits.

***“Everything to me is unisex. I have worn “womxn’s” lingerie to campus, I have about 5 pairs of sock boots. The gendering of clothing is honestly pointless to me because people should feel free to wear whatever they want however they want.”***

The interview was concluded with some golden advice that has personally helped me on multiple occasions:

**“*Honestly, as cliché as this sounds, if you feel good in it you most probably look good in it. And don’t be afraid to dig deep into your cupboard, you might surprise yourself and find a hidden treasure?”***

To put it simply: break boundaries, be yourself, dig deep and always keep it moving.

Sincerely, Sine.
